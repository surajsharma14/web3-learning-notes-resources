### What is the Consensus Problem?

In a blockchain, thousands of computers (nodes) run independently with **no central authority.**
The big challenge is: **how do all of them agree on the same truth?**

Consensus is the process that helps all nodes:

- Agree on transaction history

- Maintain one shared, verified record

- Trust the system without trusting each other
