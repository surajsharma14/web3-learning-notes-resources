# Blockchain Architecture

If you’re new to Web3, blockchain architecture simply means:
how a blockchain works internally, how data is stored, how decisions are made and how the system stays secure without anyone being in charge.

This part can feel heavy at first and that’s normal.

 ## **Why Blockchain Architecture Matters**

- Helps you understand security, decentralization, and trust

- Explains why blockchains are hard to hack or manipulate

- Needed to understand concepts like Proof of Stake, reorgs and 51% attacks

## Core Building Blocks of Blockchain Architecture
#### The Big Idea (Before Details)

**A blockchain is just:**

- A shared record

- Stored on many computers

- That everyone agrees on

- And no one can secretly change

Everything in blockchain architecture exists to make that one idea work.
